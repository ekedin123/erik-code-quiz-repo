# JS and JQuery Code Quiz
## Description

The purpose of this program is to create a timed, multiple choice quiz on a webpage where the user must select all of the right answers before the time runs out.

- the reason for this project was to create a funny and interactive quiz that the user can repeatedly attempt to get a better score.
- this project was meant to demonstrate my learning more advanced concepts of JavaScript and JQuery.

## Installation

this project runs as a web application which can be accessed through any standard web browser.

## Usage

the webpage opens with the title of the quiz and how to play, the user then starts the quiz by clicking the start button.

then the user is presented with 1 question out of 5, with 4 options for each question to choose from.

if the user selects the right answer, the quiz saves it and moves to the next question.

if the user selects the wrong answer, the quiz has them try again until they get it right.

at the end of the quiz, whether the user guesses all questions in time or not, the user is prompted to enter their initals to save to a scoreboard that can be displayed with the "See Highscores" button.
